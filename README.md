# Project Overview
This is `Banktest`, full stack web application for managing bank of questions, supporting multiple choice questions, true/false questions, short and long answer questions. It is built with 
- `Laravel` 
- `Blade`
- `Tailwind`
- `JQuery`
- `AlpineJS`
  
There are two main parts of the application, a part for viewing questions and a part for managing questions. 
You can do with questions the following:
- `view`
- `edit`
- `create`
- `delete`
- `search`
  
It uses `MySQL` as database with a simplest structure possible. (you can find everything [here](database/migrations/2022_12_28_174409_create_questions_table.php))\
Question model of `questions` table has the following fields:
- `id`
- `type` may be `[checkbox, radio, text, textarea]`. This are the names decided by app creator aka me. It can be mapped to any other names if someone don't like mines =).
- `body`
- `timestamps`
  
Answer model of `answers` table has the following fields:
- `id`
- `question_id` foreign key to `questions` table
- `body`
- `result` is any integer number specifying the amount of points user gets for answering a question correctly. 0 if the answer is wrong.
- `timestamps`

With the above structure any kind of `question` can be created. I will pay you if you can find a question that can't be created with the above structure. 

THAT'S IT!, you can find the default `Laravel` `README.md` below.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
